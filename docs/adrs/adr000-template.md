The header section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts.
```

## Decision

This section describes our response to these forces. It is stated in full sentences, with active voice. "We will â€¦"
```

### Rationale

Describe here the rationale for the design decision. Also indicate the rationale for significant rejected alternatives. This section may also indicate assumptions, constraints, requirements, and results of evaluations and experiments.
```
