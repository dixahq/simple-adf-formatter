# ADR-001 - Include language specific formatters in bundle

*Status*: draft (2022-09-18)

---

Formatters supporting specific frameworks have dependencies: A react formatter
requires at least `JSX.element` to be available, a Vue formatter requires - well - Vue, e.g.

It is possible to declare these dependencies as optional `peer` and `dev`
dependency, which allows dropping the package into a framework-specific project
and use the resp. formatter. (At least, it *should*. We need to verify this.)

The upside of this is are:

* Consuming projects could more easily benefit from formatter updates from the
  community.
* The developer experience is streamlined; only one-size-fits all bundle needs
  to be considered.

The approach has the following drawbacks:

* The bundle size is (unnecessarily) increased. Having only the parser and types
  in the bundle would make it weigh in at ~500B. Adding MD, JXS and Vue
  increases the size to 1.5kB, which still isn't much.
* The project definition is more complicated, optional peer dependencies are not
  commonly used.

Alternatives to consider:

* One package containing both parser and formatters. This is the currently
  implemented approach.
* One package for the parser, one package per formatter.
  * `-` More packages to deal with
  * `+` No dependency gymnastics required
  * `+` Minimal bundle sizes
  * `-` Developers have to deal with two packages instead of one and need to
    pick compatible versions.

* One package for the parser, include formatters in examples only as blueprints
  that can be copied.
  * `+` Only one package to deal with
  * `-` Formatter implementations cannot be shared with the community as natural
    part of the project.
  * `+` Example projects allow for a more thorough usage guide
  * `-` Developers have to implement/copy formatters into their own projects.
    Although probably most projects will do so anyway, perhaps extending
    existing formatters.

## Decision

## Consequences

```txt
This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the future.
